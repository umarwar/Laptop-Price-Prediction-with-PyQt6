# Laptop-Price-Prediction-with-PyQt6
As the name suggest 

The project "Laptop Price Prediction" aims to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt framework and implement a machine learning algorithm to predict the price of laptops based on their specifications. The application will also use MySQL as the database to store and manage the users/admin data.

# The application will have the following functionalities:
sign-in/sign-up: The application has the login and regestration mode to add the new users and login the pre register users and all the data manage in MySQL database.

Data Collection: The application will collect laptop specifications data from various sources and store it in the CSV Format.

Data Cleaning: The collected data will be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or irrelevant data.

Data Visualization: The application will have interactive data visualization tools to help the user explore the data.

Machine Learning Model: The application will use a supervised machine learning algorithm such as Random Forest or Support Vector Regression to predict the price of laptops based on their specifications.

Price Prediction: The user will be able to input the laptop specifications, and the application will predict the price of the laptop based on the machine learning model.

Database Functions: The application will use MySQL to store and manage the user/admin data, including adding new user/admin, editing existing users/admin, and deleting user/admin.

User Interface: The application will have a user-friendly graphical user interface built using PyQt, making it easy for users to interact with the system.

# Overall, the "Laptop Price Prediction" project aims to provide a useful tool for users to predict the price of laptops accurately. With the machine learning algorithm and MySQL database functions, the application will provide an intelligent, efficient, and user-friendly experience for the users.
